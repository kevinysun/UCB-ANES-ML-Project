# UC Berkeley Intro to Machine Learning Final Project: ANES Election Data Classification
 
## Description

This repository contains the code and data for a 2-week final project in UC Berkeley's Intro to Machine Learning course, where I worked with the [American National Election Survey data](https://electionstudies.org/data-center/2016-time-series-study/). This survey is done pre and post every American election and asks questions about various social and political topics. For the project, we used random forests and AdaBoost ensemble learners to classify whether a person voted Democratic or Republican for the Presidential election in 2016 using their answers to various apolitical questions from the survey. 

For the complete methodology and analysis, refer to [the final report](CS289-Final-Report.pdf) submitted by Kevin Sun and Axel Amzallag.
